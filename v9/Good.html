<h1 style="text-align: center;">What you need to know about food allergies</h1>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">An allergen is any material (antigen), most commonly ingested or
inhaled, that the immune system identifies and induces an allergic reaction. 
</p><hr>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">The common allergens are dust, pollen and
pet dander but something can be allergic.Many humans mount major responses to IgE (immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody class) only as a defence against parasite infections. 
</p><hr>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">Some individuals therefore mount an IgE
response to specific antigens of the environment.The genetic predisposition
is known as atopy.Non-parasitic antigens induce excessive development of IgE in atopic individuals, leading to hypersensitivity for type I.

</p><hr>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">A nonparasitic antigen capable of inducing a type I hypersensitivity reaction is considered an allergen in atopic individuals.The sensitivities vary from person to person, and
an incredible number of substances may be allergic. 
The sensitivities vary from person to person, and an incredible number of substances may be allergic.The common allergens are dust, pollen and pet dander,but may be allergic to anything from chlorine to perfume. 

Food allergies are not as common as food allergy, but in many cases some foods such as peanuts (really a legume), nuts, seafood and shellfish are the cause of serious allergies. 


Officially, eight foods are recognised by the Food and Drug Administration as normal for allergic reactions in a wide segment of the susceptible population, including peanuts, tree nuts,
eggs, milk, shellfish, fish, wheat and their derivatives, soy and their derivatives, and sulphites (chemical dependent, also present in food flavours and colours) at 10 ppm and above. 
</p><hr>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">This should be remembered that other countries will change the "official" list of allergens due
to variations in their citizens ' genetic profiles and varying rates of exposure to different foods.


Canada acknowledges all eight of US-recognized
allergens, and acknowledges Sesame Seeds as well. 

Poison ivy is a plant growing in 70-85
per cent of humans can cause an allergic reaction.



</p><hr>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">Nevertheless, provided enough frequent contact — like any allergy,
most human bodies can learn to counter the allergen. 

An allergic reaction can be induced by some sort of close contact with the allergen — eating or drinking a food that you are
prone to (ingestion), breathing in pollen, perfume or pet dander (inhalation), or rubbing your body against an allergy-causing plant (external touch, usually leading to hives). 

Many common causes of extreme allergies include wasp,
bee and fire ant stings, penicillin, and latex.
</p><hr>

<p style="font-size: 40px;">





An extremely dangerous type of an allergic reaction
is called anaphylaxis which can kill in mere minutes. 

One form of treatment is the administration of sterile epinephrine (via "Epi-Pen") to the person with anaphylaxis, which suppresses the overreaction of
the body to the food ingested and allows time for transportation to a medical facility (it does not "heal" the allergic reaction).
